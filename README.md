# card-number-JS-course
This repository contains 2 folders. In 'game' I took my old 'find pair' card game and wrote 'scenario' using cypress. In 'pay-form' I use the simple 'enter card number' form to then test all my functions with JEST. As well in this small project I've learned woh to use Webpack.
